# :heart: Helper
This project is an attempt at making a machine-learning model that can predict whether a person has heart disease or not without having to visit a doctor through the following inputs:
* age (integer)
* sex (1 = male; 0 = female)
* chest pain location (1 = substernal; 0 = otherwise) 
* pain is provoked by exertion? (1 = provoked by exertion; 0 = otherwise)
* relieved after rest? (1 = relieved after rest; 0 = otherwise) 
* resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) (systolic) (If your blood pressure is 120/80, then enter 120)
* do you smoke? (1 = yes; 0 = no)
* maximum heart rate achieved
